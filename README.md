In the union method, "key" is the primary key. However, this is not very useful as there might be cases where "key" is not unique for each row.

We did not implement the Harrison_Ford test case which corresponded to the below method which was to be 
implemented in Project 2.

public Table select(KeyType keyVal) {
        out.println("RA> " + name + ".select (" + keyVal + ")");

        List<Comparable[]> rows = new ArrayList<>();

        // T O B E I M P L E M E N T E D - Project 2

        return new Table(name + count++, attribute, domain, key, rows);
    } // select
