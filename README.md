Shriya Rasale Contribution: Select method
Anjali Devarapalli Contribution: Implemented Union without duplicates and Project without duplicate functions. Tested union and project implementations. 



In the union method, "key" is the primary key. However, this is not very useful as there might be cases where "key" is not unique for each row.
